## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Set required JWT secret
export INDELIBLE_JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-at-least-32-chars"

# Run with defaults (SQLite, port 8080)
./indelible --config indelible.toml
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. **The first user to register automatically becomes admin.**

### Requirements

- **antd daemon** — either managed automatically (`INDELIBLE_ANTD_MANAGED=true`) or running externally (default: `http://localhost:8082`)
- **Database** — SQLite (default, zero-config) or PostgreSQL 14+

---

## Configuration

Indelible reads configuration from a TOML file and/or environment variables. Environment variables take precedence.

### Config File (`indelible.toml`)

```toml
port = 8080
db_url = "sqlite:///var/lib/indelible/data.db"
antd_url = "http://localhost:8082"
data_dir = "/var/lib/indelible"
antd_managed = false        # set true to spawn antd automatically
antd_bin = "antd"           # path to antd binary (searches PATH)
jwt_secret = "your-secret-key-at-least-32-chars"
debug = false
cors_allowed_origins = ["https://files.acme.com"]
trusted_proxies = ["127.0.0.1/32"]
base_url = "https://files.acme.com"
wallet_encryption_key = "64-hex-char-key-for-aes-256-gcm"

[smtp]
host = "smtp.example.com"
port = 587
username = "noreply@example.com"
password = "smtp-password"
from = "noreply@example.com"
use_tls = true
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `INDELIBLE_PORT` | HTTP listen port | `8080` |
| `INDELIBLE_DB_URL` | Database connection string | `sqlite:///var/lib/indelible/data.db` |
| `INDELIBLE_ANTD_URL` | antd daemon URL | `http://localhost:8082` |
| `INDELIBLE_DATA_DIR` | Data directory for temp files | `/var/lib/indelible` |
| `INDELIBLE_JWT_SECRET` | **Required.** Secret for JWT signing | — |
| `INDELIBLE_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging | `false` |
| `INDELIBLE_CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins | — |
| `INDELIBLE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | Comma-separated CIDR ranges | — |
| `INDELIBLE_BASE_URL` | External URL for links in emails | — |
| `INDELIBLE_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex key for wallet encryption | placeholder (insecure) |
| `INDELIBLE_SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname | — |
| `INDELIBLE_SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server port | `587` |
| `INDELIBLE_SMTP_USERNAME` | SMTP username | — |
| `INDELIBLE_SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password | — |
| `INDELIBLE_SMTP_FROM` | Sender email address | — |
| `INDELIBLE_SMTP_USE_TLS` | Use STARTTLS | `false` |
| `INDELIBLE_ANTD_MANAGED` | Spawn and manage antd as child process | `false` |
| `INDELIBLE_ANTD_BIN` | Path to antd binary | `antd` (searches PATH) |

### Managed antd

When `antd_managed = true` (or `INDELIBLE_ANTD_MANAGED=true`), indelible will:
1. Check if antd is already running (via port file auto-discovery)
2. If not, spawn antd on a random free port
3. Wait for antd to write its port file and pass health checks
4. Monitor the process and restart on crash (up to 3 times)
5. Stop antd when indelible shuts down

This is recommended for development and single-node deployments. For production with separate antd instances (e.g. Docker Compose), set `INDELIBLE_ANTD_URL` explicitly instead.

### Database Selection

- **SQLite** (default): `db_url = "sqlite:///path/to/data.db"` — zero config, good for small deployments
- **PostgreSQL**: `db_url = "postgres://user:pass@host/indelible"` — recommended for 10+ concurrent users

### Wallet Encryption Key

Wallet private keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. Generate a secure key:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Set the resulting 64-character hex string as `INDELIBLE_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. **If you lose this key, encrypted wallet keys become unrecoverable.**

---

## Authentication

### Registration

1. Navigate to `/register` in your browser
2. Enter email, password (minimum 8 characters), first name, last name
3. The first registered user automatically receives admin permissions
4. A verification email is sent if SMTP is configured (non-blocking — you can use the app immediately)

### Login

Navigate to `/login` and enter your email and password. Login is rate-limited to **5 attempts per minute per IP** to prevent brute force attacks.

### Password Reset

1. Click "Forgot password?" on the login page
2. Enter your email address — a reset link is sent if SMTP is configured
3. Click the link in your email and set a new password
4. The response is always the same regardless of whether the email exists (prevents email enumeration)

**Note:** Password reset requires SMTP configuration. Without it, reset tokens are logged to server output.

### Email Verification

A verification email is sent automatically on registration. Click the link to verify your email address.

- Verification tokens expire after **24 hours**
- To resend: call `POST /api/v2/me/resend-verification` (requires authentication)
- Verification requires SMTP configuration. Without it, tokens are logged to server output.

### Changing Password

Go to **Profile** (click your name in the sidebar) to change your password. You must provide your current password.

---

## File Uploads

### Uploading Files

**Via Dashboard:**
1. Go to the Dashboard (`/`)
2. Select a file, choose visibility (public or private), and click Upload
3. The file is queued for upload to the Autonomi network

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/uploads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F "visibility=private"
```

### Upload Status

Files go through these stages:
- **Queued** — received and waiting for background processing
- **Processing** — being uploaded to the Autonomi network
- **Completed** — available for download with a permanent network address
- **Failed** — error occurred (check error message)

### Downloading Files

Completed files can be downloaded from the Uploads page or via API:

```bash
curl -O -J https://files.acme.com/api/v2/uploads/{uuid}/download \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Visibility

- **Private** (default): only the uploader can access the file
- **Public**: stored as public data on the Autonomi network

### Cost Quote

Get an exact cost quote before uploading by sending the actual file. antd runs self-encryption on the bytes and queries the live network for chunk pricing — no estimation, no scaling.

```bash
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/uploads/quote \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F "visibility=private"
```

The response includes a structured `estimated_cost` breakdown:

```json
{
  "estimated_cost": {
    "cost": "123456789",
    "file_size": 1048576,
    "chunk_count": 4,
    "estimated_gas_cost_wei": "45000000000",
    "payment_mode": "auto"
  },
  "file_size": 1048576,
  "original_filename": "document.pdf",
  "visibility": "private"
}
```

- `cost` — storage cost in atto tokens
- `estimated_gas_cost_wei` — advisory gas heuristic, not a live gas-oracle quote
- `payment_mode` — `auto`, `merkle`, or `single`

---

## Collections & Tags

### Tags

**Set tags at upload time** (recommended for programmatic workflows):

```bash
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/uploads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@document.pdf" \
  -F 'visibility=private' \
  -F 'tags={"department":"legal","project":"alpha","client":"acme"}'
```

**Set/update tags after upload** (replace-all semantics):

```bash
curl -X PUT https://files.acme.com/api/v2/uploads/{uuid}/tags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tags": {"department": "legal", "project": "alpha"}}'
```

**Auto-tag rules** — Admins can create rules that automatically apply tags at upload time (Admin > Tag Rules). Rules match on content type, filename regex, file size, or visibility.

### Searching by Tags

**Label selector syntax** (recommended — supports equality, inequality, set membership, existence):

```bash
# Equality
curl "https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/search?selector=department=legal" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Inequality
curl "https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/search?selector=status!=archived" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Set membership
curl "https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/search?selector=env in (prod,staging)" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Key exists / not exists
curl "https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/search?selector=reviewed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Combined with filename search
curl "https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/search?selector=department=legal,status!=archived&q=contract" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Legacy syntax** (backward compatible):

```bash
curl "https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/search?tag.department=legal&q=contract" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Bulk Tag Operations

Apply or remove tags across multiple files at once:

```bash
# By UUID list
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"upload_uuids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"], "add_tags": {"archived": "true"}}'

# By selector (tag all completed legal files as reviewed)
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"selector": "department=legal,status=completed", "add_tags": {"reviewed": "true"}}'
```

### Tag Facets

Get aggregated tag counts for building filter UIs:

```bash
curl "https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tags/facets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
# Returns: {"facets": [{"key":"department","value":"legal","count":42}, ...]}
```

### Collections

Collections are virtual folders for organising files. Create them from the Collections page or via API:

```bash
# Create collection
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/collections \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Q1 Tax Docs", "description": "Tax documents for Q1 2026"}'

# Add file to collection (use upload UUID)
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/collections/{id}/files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"upload_uuid": "abc-123-..."}'
```

Collections support hierarchical nesting via `parent_id`. Deleting a parent collection cascades to all children.

---

## API Tokens

API tokens provide programmatic access for CI/CD pipelines, integrations, and automation.

### Creating Tokens

1. Go to **API Tokens** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Token**
3. Set a name, scope (read/write/admin), and expiry
4. **Copy the token immediately** — it's shown only once

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://files.acme.com/api/v2/tokens \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "CI Pipeline", "scope": "write", "expires_in_days": 90}'
```

### Token Scopes

- **read** — list and download files, view uploads
- **write** — upload files, manage tags and collections
- **admin** — full access including user management (only admins can create admin tokens)

### Using Tokens

Pass the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ind_abc123..." https://files.acme.com/api/v2/uploads
```

### Revoking Tokens

Tokens can be revoked from the UI or API. Revocation is permanent — create a new token instead.

---

## Admin: User Management

*Requires admin permissions.*

### Permissions Model

Three levels: **read**, **write**, **admin**. Admin implies write implies read.

- **Direct permissions** — set per user by admins
- **Group permissions** — inherited from group membership
- **Effective permissions** = union of direct + group

The system prevents removing the last admin.

### Service Accounts

Non-human accounts for CI pipelines and integrations:

- No password, no login — exist only to own API tokens
- Created by admins from the Users page
- Tokens survive employee departures

### Groups

Groups grant a permission level to all members. Use groups for department-level access control.

---

## Admin: Wallets

*Requires admin permissions.*

Wallets store Autonomi network credentials for paying upload costs.

### Setup

1. Go to **Admin > Wallets**
2. Click **Add Wallet**
3. Enter the wallet name, address, and private key
4. The first wallet is automatically set as default

**Important:** The private key is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. Ensure `INDELIBLE_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set to a secure value.

### Default Wallet

The default wallet is used for all upload payments. Click **Set Default** on any wallet to change it.

---

## Admin: Storage Quotas

*Requires admin permissions. Quotas are disabled by default.*

Quotas prevent runaway storage costs by limiting total upload volume.

### Quota Types

| Entity Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `system` | Global limit across all users |
| `user` | Per-user limit (entity_id = user ID) |
| `group` | Per-group limit |
| `department` | Per-department limit |

### Creating Quotas

1. Go to **Admin > Quotas**
2. Click **New Quota**
3. Select entity type, optional entity ID, and max storage in GB

### Enforcement

When a quota is enabled, uploads are rejected if they would exceed the limit. The usage bar on the Quotas page shows current consumption.

Quota usage is calculated from the total size of **completed** uploads.

---

## Admin: System Settings

*Requires admin permissions.*

Runtime settings are stored in the database and take effect immediately without restart.

### Available Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `environment_name` | `production` | Environment label shown in UI |
| `timezone` | `UTC` | System timezone (IANA format) |
| `max_upload_size_bytes` | `10737418240` (10 GB) | Maximum file size for uploads |
| `default_visibility` | `private` | Default upload visibility |
| `retention_days` | `30` | Log retention period |
| `maintenance_mode` | `false` | Enable maintenance mode |
| `maintenance_message` | — | Custom maintenance message |
| `jwt_expiry_hours` | `24` | JWT session lifetime |
| `default_token_expiry_days` | `90` | Default API token expiry |
| `max_concurrent_uploads` | `1` | Background upload concurrency |
| `log_retention_enabled` | `false` | Enable automatic log cleanup |
| `log_retention_days` | `30` | Days to keep non-audit logs |

### Export / Import

Instance configuration can be exported as JSON for backup or replication to another instance:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings**
2. Click **Export** to download `indelible-settings.json`
3. On another instance, click **Import** and select the file

The export includes:
- **System settings** — all runtime configuration (maintenance mode, upload limits, log retention, etc.)
- **Webhook configurations** — URLs, integration types, event subscriptions, enabled state
- **OIDC provider configurations** — names, issuer URLs, client IDs, scopes (client secrets are excluded for security — re-enter after import)
- **Group definitions** — names, descriptions, permission levels

The import is backwards-compatible with older flat settings exports. All settings changes are recorded in the config audit trail.

---

## Admin: Webhooks

*Requires admin permissions.*

Webhooks send HTTP notifications when events occur — upload status changes and system alerts. Navigate to **Admin > Webhooks** in the sidebar.

### Creating a Webhook

1. Click **Add Endpoint**
2. Enter the endpoint URL
3. Choose integration type: **Generic JSON** or **Slack**
4. Select which events to subscribe to:
   - **Upload events:** `queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`
   - **System events:** `disk_warning`, `disk_critical`, `disk_recovered`
5. Click **Create Webhook**

### Managing Webhooks

- **Enable/Disable** — toggle in the list without deleting
- **Edit** — click the pencil icon to expand an inline edit panel (URL, type, events, enabled)
- **Test** — click the lightning bolt icon to send a test ping; result shown inline
- **History** — click the clock icon to view recent delivery attempts with status codes and errors
- **Delete** — click the trash icon (requires confirmation)

### Integration Types

- **Generic** — raw JSON payload, suitable for any HTTP endpoint
- **Slack** — formatted Block Kit message for Slack incoming webhooks

### Event Types

| Event | Category | When it fires |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| `queued` | Upload | File accepted and queued for processing |
| `processing` | Upload | Worker started processing the upload |
| `completed` | Upload | Upload successfully stored on the network |
| `failed` | Upload | Upload processing failed |
| `disk_warning` | System | Disk usage reached 80% |
| `disk_critical` | System | Disk usage reached 95%, uploads paused |
| `disk_recovered` | System | Disk usage returned below warning threshold |

System alerts fire once per threshold transition — not every check interval (5 minutes).

### Delivery

- Async and non-blocking to the upload flow
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- 5-second timeout per attempt
- Every delivery attempt is logged and visible in the delivery history panel

### Payload Format (Generic — Upload Event)

```json
{
  "event_type": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-13T12:00:00Z",
  "upload": {
    "uuid": "abc-123-...",
    "user_id": 5,
    "token_id": 12,
    "filename": "document.pdf",
    "status": "completed",
    "file_size": 1048576,
    "visibility": "private",
    "actual_cost": "5000000"
  }
}
```

`user_id` is always present. `token_id` is included when the upload was created via API token — this allows API consumers to filter webhooks for their own uploads without needing per-user webhook configuration.

### Payload Format (Generic — System Event)

```json
{
  "event_type": "disk_critical",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-13T12:00:00Z",
  "system": {
    "alert_type": "disk_critical",
    "message": "Disk usage at 96.2%, uploads paused",
    "value": 96.2
  }
}
```

### Payload Format (Test Ping)

```json
{
  "event_type": "test_ping",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-13T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Admin: OIDC / SSO Providers

*Requires admin permissions.*

Indelible supports OpenID Connect for single sign-on with identity providers like Google, Microsoft, Keycloak, etc.

### Adding a Provider

1. Go to **Admin > Settings** (OIDC section)
2. Create a provider with:
   - **Name** — internal identifier (e.g., `google`)
   - **Display Name** — shown on login page (e.g., `Sign in with Google`)
   - **Issuer URL** — OIDC issuer (e.g., `https://accounts.google.com`)
   - **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — from your identity provider
   - **Scopes** — default: `openid email profile`

Client secrets are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM.

---

## Admin: SCIM Provisioning

*Requires admin permissions.*

SCIM 2.0 enables automatic user and group provisioning from identity providers such as Okta, Azure AD/Entra, and Google Workspace.

### Enabling SCIM

1. Go to **Admin > SCIM**
2. Toggle **SCIM Provisioning** to enabled
3. Note the **SCIM Base URL** displayed (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/scim/v2`)

### Generating a SCIM Token

1. Click **Generate Token**
2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Okta Production")
3. Click **Generate**
4. **Copy the token immediately** — it is shown only once
5. Use this token as the Bearer token in your identity provider's SCIM configuration

### Token Management

- View all tokens with their creation date, last used timestamp, and status
- **Revoke** a token when rotating credentials or decommissioning an IdP connection
- Revoked tokens cannot be reactivated — generate a new one instead

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v2/admin/scim/tokens` | Create a SCIM token |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/admin/scim/tokens` | List all SCIM tokens |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v2/admin/scim/tokens/{id}` | Revoke a SCIM token |

### IdP Configuration

**Okta:**
1. Add a new SCIM 2.0 application
2. Set **SCIM connector base URL** to `https://your-domain.com/scim/v2`
3. Set **Unique identifier field** to `userName`
4. Set **Authentication Mode** to `HTTP Header`
5. Paste the SCIM token in the **Authorization** field (with `Bearer ` prefix)
6. Enable **Push New Users**, **Push Profile Updates**, and **Push Groups**

**Azure AD / Entra ID:**
1. In your Enterprise Application, go to **Provisioning**
2. Set **Provisioning Mode** to `Automatic`
3. Set **Tenant URL** to `https://your-domain.com/scim/v2`
4. Set **Secret Token** to the SCIM token
5. Click **Test Connection**, then **Save**
6. Map attributes: `userPrincipalName` → `userName`, `givenName` → `name.givenName`, `surname` → `name.familyName`

**Google Workspace:**
1. Use the SCIM API endpoint `https://your-domain.com/scim/v2`
2. Configure with a Bearer token in the Authorization header

### How SCIM Maps to Indelible

| SCIM Attribute | Indelible Field |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `userName` | `email` |
| `name.givenName` | `first_name` |
| `name.familyName` | `last_name` |
| `active` | `is_active` |
| `externalId` | `external_id` |
| Group `displayName` | `name` |
| Group `members[].value` | group membership |

- SCIM-provisioned users have no password and should authenticate via OIDC/SSO
- SCIM-provisioned groups default to "read" permission level
- SCIM DELETE performs a soft-delete to preserve audit history

## Admin: Analytics

*Requires admin permissions.*

### Upload Analytics

View upload volume, success/failure rates, average processing time, and top uploaders. Filter by time period (7, 30, or 90 days).

### Token Usage

See total API requests, active token count, and most active tokens.

### Cost Analytics

Track storage costs:
- **System-wide** — total transactions and spend
- **By department** — cost allocation across teams
- **By token** — identify high-usage integrations

---

## Admin: Logs

*Requires admin permissions.*

Three log tiers:

### Audit Logs

Security events: logins, permission changes, config changes, token operations. **Never deleted** (compliance). Filterable by event type, user, and date range.

### System Logs

Internal operations: worker events, webhook delivery, errors. Searchable by level (info/warn/error) and component. Subject to log retention settings.

### User Activity Logs

User actions: uploads, downloads, tag changes. Filterable by user and date range. Subject to log retention settings.

### Log Retention

To enable automatic cleanup of system and user logs:

1. Go to **Admin > Settings**
2. Set `log_retention_enabled` to `true`
3. Set `log_retention_days` to your desired period (1–365)

Audit logs are **exempt** from retention and are kept permanently.

---

## Maintenance Mode

When enabled, all API endpoints (except `/health` and admin routes) return **503 Service Unavailable** with a custom message.

### Enabling

1. Go to **Admin > Settings**
2. Set `maintenance_mode` to `true`
3. Optionally set `maintenance_message` to a custom message

### Via API

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://files.acme.com/api/v2/admin/settings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"maintenance_mode": "true", "maintenance_message": "Upgrading — back in 30 minutes"}'
```

---

## Rate Limiting

The login endpoint is rate-limited to **5 attempts per 60 seconds per IP address**. When exceeded, requests receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

This protects against brute-force password attacks. The rate limiter uses the `X-Forwarded-For` header when behind a reverse proxy — ensure `trusted_proxies` is configured.

---

## Disk Space Monitoring

Indelible monitors the data directory for disk usage every 5 minutes:

| Threshold | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **80%** | Warning logged to system logs |
| **95%** | Critical alert, new uploads paused |
| Below 80% | Uploads automatically resume |

The health endpoint (`/health`) reflects the paused state. This is essential because the upload queue writes files to local disk before uploading to the Autonomi network.

---

## API Consumer Guide

### Request ID Tracing

Every API response includes an `X-Request-Id` header. Include this ID in support requests to help correlate issues with server-side logs.

### Rate Limiting

Rate-limited endpoints (currently login) include these headers on every response:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests per window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the window resets |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds until retry is allowed (only on 429) |

### Error Codes

Error responses include a machine-readable `code` field alongside the human-readable `error` message:

```json
{"error": "email already registered", "code": "email_taken"}
```

Common codes: `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `validation_error`, `not_found`, `email_taken`, `invalid_credentials`, `quota_exceeded`, `file_too_large`, `rate_limit_exceeded`, `maintenance_mode`, `wallet_not_configured`.

### Idempotency Keys

For upload creation (`POST /uploads`), include an `Idempotency-Key` header to safely retry requests:

```bash
curl -X POST /api/v2/uploads \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: unique-request-id-123" \
  -F file=@document.pdf
```

If the same key + user combination is sent again within 24 hours, the original response is replayed with `X-Idempotent-Replayed: true`.

### Webhook Signatures

All webhook deliveries include HMAC-SHA256 signatures for payload verification:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Signature-256` | `sha256=<hex-encoded HMAC>` |
| `X-Webhook-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp of delivery |

To verify in your receiver:
```python
import hmac, hashlib
expected = "sha256=" + hmac.new(secret.encode(), body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
assert hmac.compare_digest(expected, request.headers["X-Signature-256"])
```

Webhook secrets are generated automatically on creation and shown once. Use the **Rotate Secret** button to generate a new one.

### Upload Filtering and Sorting

`GET /uploads` supports these query parameters:

| Parameter | Example | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `status` | `completed` | Filter by upload status |
| `sort` | `file_size:asc` | Sort by field with direction |
| `from` | `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z` | Created after (RFC 3339) |
| `to` | `2026-03-01T00:00:00Z` | Created before (RFC 3339) |

Sort fields: `created_at` (default), `file_size`, `filename`, `status`.

### Cursor Pagination

List endpoints support cursor-based pagination as an alternative to offset/limit:

```bash
# First page (offset/limit — includes next_cursor in response)
GET /api/v2/uploads?limit=10

# Next page using cursor
GET /api/v2/uploads?cursor=<next_cursor_value>&limit=10
```

The response includes `next_cursor` and `prev_cursor` fields when applicable.

## Deployment

### Minimal (Single Binary + SQLite)

```bash
export INDELIBLE_JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export INDELIBLE_ANTD_URL="http://localhost:8082"
./indelible
```

### Production (Behind Reverse Proxy)

**Caddy** (simplest — automatic Let's Encrypt):
```
files.acme.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

**Nginx:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name files.acme.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/files.acme.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/files.acme.com.key;
    client_max_body_size 10g;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  indelible:
    image: autonomi/indelible:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - indelible-data:/data
    environment:
      INDELIBLE_JWT_SECRET: "your-secret-key"
      INDELIBLE_ANTD_URL: http://antd:8082
      INDELIBLE_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY: "your-64-char-hex-key"
      INDELIBLE_CORS_ORIGINS: https://files.acme.com

  antd:
    image: autonomi/antd:latest
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"

volumes:
  indelible-data:
```

### Trusted Proxies

When behind a reverse proxy, configure trusted proxy ranges so Indelible correctly reads client IPs from `X-Forwarded-For`. Without this, `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored and the direct connection IP is used (safe default). This affects rate limiting and audit log IP addresses.

```toml
trusted_proxies = ["127.0.0.1/32", "10.0.0.0/8"]
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
export INDELIBLE_TRUSTED_PROXIES="127.0.0.1/32,10.0.0.0/8"
```
